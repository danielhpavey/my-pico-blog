# Alternating Colour Bullet Points Using nth-child

I love bulleted lists for content. They're nice and easy for people to read and...

A project I was working on had a very nice colour scheme and I wanted to incorporate the colours in lots of little design touches. An obvious route to go down was to colour the bullet in any lists. 

I decided to use [nth-child](https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/) to colour every 3rd bullet differently. As you can't specify a bullets colour in CSS I was gonna have to build them with pseudo elements. 

I've had a log of practice using pseudo elements, but am not hugely familiar with nth-child. [This article on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/) was very helpful (as usual!).
